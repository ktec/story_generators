Once upon a time there was a <%= character_1 %> called <%= name_1 %>.

The <%= name_1 %> was a <%= random.(:adjective) %>, <%= random.(:adjective) %>, <%= random.(:adjective) %>, <%= random.(:adjective) %> <%= character_1 %>. <%= name_1 %> liked to <%= random.(:verb) %> <%= random.(:noun) %> and <%= random.(:verb) %> <%= random.(:noun) %>.

When the <%= character_1 %> was <%= random.(:number) %> years she fell in love with a <%= random.(:adjective) %>, <%= random.(:adjective) %>, <%= random.(:adjective) %> <%= character_2 %>, called <%= name_2 %> who was <%= random.(:number) %> years old. <%= name_2 %> also fell in love with <%= name_1 %> for her <%= random.(:adjective) %> <%= random.(:noun) %>. They really wanted to <%= random.(:verb) %> together all their lives.

But all falling in love business was against <%= character_1 %>â€™s <%= random.(:adjective) %> father will. <%= character_2 %>, who was totally in love with <%= character_1 %> conviced <%= character_1 %> father to let him marry <%= character_1 %> if <%= character_2 %> will <%= random.(:verb) %> <%= random.(:noun) %> <%= random.(:number) %> times in a row then <%= random.(:verb) %> <%= random.(:noun) %> and <%= random.(:verb) %> <%= random.(:noun) %>. <%= character_2 %> did that immediately and they lived happy ever after.
